# FoodTruckProject

# Description:
The FoodTruckProject is a Java-based application that allows users to input and rate food trucks. Users can enter details about various food trucks, such as their names, types of food they serve, and ratings. The application provides a simple menu-driven interface for users to manage and compare food trucks based on their ratings. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts in Java, including class design, user input, and data manipulation.

# Technologies Used:
- Java: The core programming language used to build the application.
- Eclipse IDE: An integrated development environment used for writing, debugging, and running Java code.
- Git: A version control system for tracking changes to the project's source code.
- GitHub: A web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on the project's code.

# Lessons Learned
- Object-Oriented Programming. This project provided a hands-on experience in designing and implementing classes and objects
- User Input and Menu Interfaces
- Package Organization
- Working with arrays, loops, and conditional statements to manage and analyze food truck data.
- Version Control. The use of Git and GitHub allowed for collaboration, version tracking, and backup of project code.
- Project Planning
